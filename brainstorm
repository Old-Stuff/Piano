JSON File that stores the information about the piano

id (midi note)
|__Color (White | Black)
|__Name (A, A#, B, C, etc...)
|__Octave (I, II, III, etc...)

an array of selected notes generates the shapes...

generic shape for white key / black key
goes through selection and makes list of white keys and black keys
starting at the smallest white key it generates a shape on screen starting at 0, 0
takes the smallest of the black key and the white key and generates that shape
rinse and repeat... could be done with recursion and pop.
This may need to change white and black keys depending on number of selected notes....


start with arrays to test... but eventually move to a gui that can easily allow users to select notes,
perhaps these values could be stored as a two digit hex 0x00 - 0xFF (for 256 independent notes.... more may be needed for microtonal keyboard)

A way to filter keys and make keyboards 
placement of black keys based on diatonic scale confusing if filtering notes...
need to find a way to reorganize white / black as neccessary

Binding to keyboard... should it be arbitrary?  
Maybe mapped depending on what is being done...

GRID!!!!

grid of these f'n box's... mapping notes in keys...

drag through them.

Map keyboard on same grid... drag fingers across keyboard
